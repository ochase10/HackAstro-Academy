# Instructions to Install Conda on a Mac Computer

1. **Download the Installer:**
    - Go to the [Miniconda download page](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/).
    - Download the macOS installer for your system: Terminal (either 64-bit (bash installer) or GUI 64-bit (pkg installer)).

2. **Install Miniconda:**
    - Open the Terminal application.
    - Navigate to the directory where the installer was downloaded. For example:
      ```
      cd ~/Downloads
      ```
    - Run the Terminal installer script if you chose this. For the bash installer, use:
      ```
      bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
      ```
      For the GUI Package installer follow the prompts to complete the installation.
    - For the pkg installer, double-click the downloaded file and follow the instructions.

3. **Initialize Conda:**
    - After installation, initialize conda by running:
      ```
      conda init
      ```
    - Restart your terminal or run:
      ```
      source ~/.bashrc
      ```
      or
      ```
      source ~/.zshrc
      ```
      depending on your shell.

4. **Verify Installation:**
    - To verify that conda is installed correctly, run:
      ```
      conda --version
      ```
      This should display the version of conda installed.

5. **Update Conda:**
    - It is a good practice to update conda to the latest version:
      ```
      conda update conda
      ```
