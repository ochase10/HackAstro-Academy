    "# Introduction to 2D and ND Arrays in NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2D Arrays\n",
    "A 2D array is a matrix with rows and columns. It is essentially an array of arrays. In NumPy, you can create a 2D array using the `numpy.array()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ND Arrays\n",
    "An ND array (N-dimensional array) is a generalization of 2D arrays to any number of dimensions. NumPy can handle arrays of arbitrary dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy provides a wide range of functions to manipulate and operate on these arrays, making it a fundamental tool for scientific computing in Python."
