    "So far we have seen the power of numpy and making our own functions to carry out calculations. One of the ways that we make sure the calculations are correct is by checking the numeric output. Another way is by plotting up numbers and seeing if they make sense. This can be as simple as checking the trend in a dataset, plotting up a model and see how the model compares with the data. There are a lot of ways to plot in Python each of which showcases a unique aspect of the data. We will go over some of the most common plotting functions using matplotlib."
