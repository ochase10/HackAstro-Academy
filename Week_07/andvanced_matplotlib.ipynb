    "# Object Oriented Plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented plotting using ax objects in Matplotlib is a powerful way to create and customize plots. This approach provides finer control over the plot elements and, crucially, allows for multiple plots in the same figure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented just means that we're going to think about each plot, or set of axes, as an object. We're then going to manipulate parts of that object. Then we'll put all our objects together to form our final figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've let PyPlot handle most of our figure for us. We simply tell it what we want, and it does it in a way that makes sense. This is ok for single plots because there is no ambiguity in the x-label or title, for example. When things start to get more complex, we simply expose the underlying PyPlot structures so that we can keep everything in order.\n",
