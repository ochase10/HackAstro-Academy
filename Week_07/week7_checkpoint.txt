For this week's checkpoint you're going to do a basic physics problem.

Imagine we drop a ball from some initial height with some initial velocity. Your goal is to compute the
trajectory of the ball and then plot it against time. 

Write a script (function, Python file, notebook, etc) that takes initial values for position and velocity, along with a
time interval. Compute the position of a ball free falling with those initial conditions over that time
interval. It's up to you how you want to subdivide the interval. You should then plot the position of the
ball (on the y axis) against time (on the x axis) as a scatter plot using matplotlib. Be sure to properly 
label the axes and otherwise make the plot good-looking.

There is an example of such a plot given as 'week7_cp_example1.png'.

To step up the complexity a little bit, try plotting x position against y position for a trajectory. In
this case, each point will still represent a moment in time. 'week7_cp_example2.png' is an example.

You can also consider additional options like adjustable gravity strength.
