    "\n",
    "We've seen how functions make it easy to write general-purpose routines that we can reuse, saving us from rewriting the code. You can imagine that there are a vast number of functions that might be useful for our coding purposes. Some of these are implemented for us in default Python. Things like addition, writing to files, appending elements to lists, are functions that someone wrote and made accessible to you when you launch the Python executable. However, despite the large set of functions packaged with Python by default, there are many possibly useful functions that are not. We wouldn't want the Python install to be a terrabyte, after all. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python doesn't include all the functions we want, we can always just write what we need ourselves. But writing software, especially efficient, reliable, and complicated software, is time consuming and requires a lot of background knowledge. It might even require writing in other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we might want a function that takes 2 lists and creates an image showing the data plotted as pairs of coordinates on a set of axes. We could spend weeks or months toiling away trying to write our own function to do this, or we could just let someone else do it and copy their function (with their permission of course). That was the beauty of functions after all, they're portable code blocks that aren't tied to any specific use-case/program. This is where packages come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python packages are essentially libraries of functions written by others and kindly distributed to us for free. So how does it work? Well, first we need to download and install these fancy libraries. Then we simply load them into our environment and we're free to use them to our heart's content. It's as easy as that. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Some Noteworthy Packages:\n",
    "1. NumPy: Elaborate suite of math and array functions. Maybe the most common package in Python\n",
    "2. SciPy: Extensive set of useful scientific functions useful for statistics, math, and more\n",
    "3. Matplotlib: An excellent package for creating custom plots and data visualizations\n",
    "4. Pandas: A data analysis package built around implementing DataFrame objects\n",
    "5. AstroPy: A utility package for all things astronomy\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that even these packages use packages! In fact, #2-5 are all built on top of NumPy!\n",
    "\n",
    "There's genuinely nothing special about the code contained in packages. You could write it yourself given enough time. They just save us from re-doing things other people already did, allowing us to focus on the fun science. It also helps maintain interoperability. Many packages work seamlessly together because they are both built on NumPy. You can imagine how complicated things would get if everyone did everything their own way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's import a package\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the next cell, ensure that you have NumPy installed. If you're using a conda distribution of Python, go to the terminal, activate your desired environment and run 'conda install numpy'. If that fail or you are not using conda, go to a terminal and run 'pip install numpy'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, packages are libraries *external* to Python. We have to download and install them in order to use them. We'll talk more about package managers at the end of this notebook, but you've been reading for a while already so let's run some code!"

This has important implication if you are working with many different arrays and they need to be the same size for plotting. The way to fix this is that you would need to apply this mask to the other arrays as well to make sure they are the same size and match up for any subsequent analysis and plotting purposes."
