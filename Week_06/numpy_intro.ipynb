    "NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions to operate on these data structures efficiently. NumPy is essential for numerical computations and serves as the foundation for many other scientific libraries, including SciPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would take years to cover all there is to know about NumPy, so here we'll focus on understanding the basics and buliding the tools to find and use the functions that we need as we need them. If you want your basics straight from the NumPy team, check out their [beginner's guide](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html). \n",

    "To start, recall how we import a package. For this notebook, we'll use the traditional np alias."

    "That might seem well and good, but you still may be wondering why NumPy is the backbone of any numerical work in Python. Aside from the excellent additions to default Python that NumPy provides, NumPy performs much, *much* better than default Python. That is because in the background, NumPy is implemented in C, which allows it to far outpace the canonically slow Python interpreter. Let's take a look at an example to see what I mean. For the next couple lines, we'll be using the magic phrase %%timeit; don't worry about this. All it does is time the execution of the cell over several iterations.\n",
