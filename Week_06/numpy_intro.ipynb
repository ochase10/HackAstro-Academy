    "NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions to operate on these data structures efficiently. NumPy is essential for numerical computations and serves as the foundation for many other scientific libraries, including SciPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would take years to cover all there is to know about NumPy, so here we'll focus on understanding the basics and buliding the tools to find and use the functions that we need as we need them. If you want your basics straight from the NumPy team, check out their [beginner's guide](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html). \n",

    "But that's not all that impressive. NumPy's biggest feature is the introduction of the ndarray class. Arrays are much like lists, but have far greater functionality. Unlike lists, arrays are meant to contain a single data type, usually something numeric. This is not enforced, but much or all of the added functionality of NumPy over lists is lost by assigning heterogenous data types. \n",

    "That might seem well and good, but you still may be wondering why NumPy is the backbone of any numerical work in Python. Aside from the excellent additions to default Python that NumPy provides, NumPy performs much, *much* better than default Python. That is because in the background, NumPy is implemented in C, which allows it to far outpace the canonically slow Python interpreter. Let's take a look at an example to see what I mean. For the next couple lines, we'll be using the magic phrase %%timeit; don't worry about this. All it does is time the execution of the cell over several iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple example, we'll create an array/list with 1 million numbers (0-999,999). Then we'll update the list by multiplying each number by 5. Note that neither implementation below is the most efficient way to achieve the final result using lists or arrays, but it is a fair comparsion because they do they same operations in the same order."
