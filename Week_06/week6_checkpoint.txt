This week's checkpoint is a simple numerical problem. 

Write a function which converts decimal numbers to binary. 

Implement the function in a .py file and load it from a different 
program which makes it accessible to a command line (or Jupyter notebook) user.
The wrapper program should ensure the user's input is valid.

Example input/output:

toBinary(10) -> 1010
toBinary(7) -> 111
toBinary(64) -> 1000000
