So if you have 2 arrays with 3 numbers in them say arr1 = np.array([1, 5, 10]) and arr2 = np.array([10, 20, 30]) when you do an operation say addition. This operation is applied to the same indexes so 1 will get added to 10, 5 will get added to 20 and 10 will get added to 30 making the resulting array be np.array([11, 25, 40]). This same methodology is applied if you add another array into the mix where similar indexes have the operation applied to them. See the example below of this in action.\n",

This has important implication if you are working with many different arrays and they need to be the same size for plotting. The way to fix this is that you would need to apply this mask to the other arrays as well to make sure they are the same size and match up for any subsequent analysis and plotting purposes."

    "You can also perform mathematical operators between 2D arrays and 1D arrays but there is a criteria that must be met, the 1D array $\\textbf{MUST}$ be the same size as the columns of the 2D array. So if you have a 10 x 12 array the 1D array needs to be length 12 to perform mathematical operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way math is carried out between these two is that every row gets the math operator applied making sure that the same elements are undergoing the operation. To explain this with an example let us take the following array: np.array([[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 8], [3, 6, 9]]) and the 1D-array np.array([2, 2, 2]) and let's say I need to multiply these two arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "What will happen is that numpy will take the first row of the 2D array and perform the multiplication [1, 2, 3] * [2, 2, 2] and since we have two 1D arrays of the same length we perform the operation element-wise. The output for this is going to be: [2, 4, 6] and this will be the new row1 in the output 2D array. The second row then does the same operation: [2, 4, 8] * [2, 2, 2] = [4, 8, 16] and this will be the second row and so on. so the resulting 2D array from this operation will be: np.array([[2, 4, 6], [4, 8, 16], [6, 12, 18]]). \n"
