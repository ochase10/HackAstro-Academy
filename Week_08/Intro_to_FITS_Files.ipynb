    "# Introduction to Astronomy FITS Files and Tools in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) is a digital file format widely used in astronomy for storing, transmitting, and processing scientific and other images. FITS files are designed to store not only image data but also metadata, which includes information about the data, such as the observation date, instrument used, and various calibration parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "FITS files are highly versatile and can store multi-dimensional data arrays (e.g., 2D images, 3D data cubes) and binary tables. This makes them an essential format for astronomers and astrophysicists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools in Python to Explore FITS Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers several libraries to work with FITS files, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Astropy**: A comprehensive library for astronomy that includes tools for reading, writing, and manipulating FITS files.\n",
    "2. **FITSio**: A lightweight library for reading and writing FITS files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Using Astropy to Explore FITS Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Astropy provides a `fits` module that allows you to open, inspect, and manipulate FITS files easily. Below is an example of how to use Astropy to open a FITS file and explore its contents:\n"
