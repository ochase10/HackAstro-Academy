This will be the first week with a checkpoint, little assignments you 
do outside of class to make sure you're keeping up with the class.

These aren't meant to be stressful or time-consuming. Take you best crack at
them, but if you spend over half an hour, take a break and ask for help or 
come to the next class with questions. These are really checks of how well
we are teaching, so if you don't know how to do them, let us know!

This week's checkpoint involves lists and control flow. 

Your objective is to write a program which prints only valid items in a list. 
We have prepared a partial program in w3_check.py which we want you to finish.

Each time you run the code, it will generate a new list and assign it to a variable.
You must print only the values of the list which are positive integers to the screen,
one-by-one. 

Ex: 
> python w3_check.py
> [-6, 2, 3, 7.1, '-9', '3', 1.4, 9, -2.9, 1, -5]
> 2
> 3
> 9
> 1
