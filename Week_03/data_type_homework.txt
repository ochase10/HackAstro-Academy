Part 1: Lists

a) Create a list called numbers containing the values [3, 7, 2, 9].
b) Use .append() to add the number 5 to the list.
c) Use .remove() to delete the number 7 from the list.
d) Use .sort() to arrange the list in ascending order.
e) Print the length of the list using len().

What is the final list after these operations?

Part 2: Tuples

a) Create a tuple called colors with three colors of your choice.
b) Try using .append() on the tuple. What happens? (Write your observation.)
c) Use indexing ([]) to print the second color in the tuple.
d) Try changing one of the elements in the tuple. What happens?

Part 3: Dictionaries

a) Create a dictionary called student with the following key-value pairs:

student = {"name": "Alex", "age": 20, "grade": "B"}

b) Use print(student["name"]) to display the student's name.
c) Change the student's grade to "A" by updating the dictionary.
d) Add a new key "major" with the value "Astronomy"
e) Use .keys() and .values() to print all keys and all values in the dictionary.

Part 4: Strings

a) Create a string variable sentence with the value "Python is fun!".
b) Use .upper() to convert it to uppercase.
c) Use .replace("fun", "awesome") to change the word "fun" to "awesome".
d) Use .split() to break the sentence into a list of words.
e) Use indexing ([]) to print just the first letter of the string.

Bonus Challenge!
Try using input() to ask the user for their name and store it in a variable. Then, print a message like:
print("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to Python.")
