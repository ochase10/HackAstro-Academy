    "## How do if statements work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down what happens when your program encounters an if statement. First, it sees the keyword 'if' which is a protected word in Python: you can't use that word as a variable. Following the 'if' keyword, Python looks for a *boolean* statement. We talked about boolean variables in the lesson on data types. A boolean statement is any statement that *evaluates* to True or False. Evaluation is the process of \"solving\" an expression to it's final value. Imagine someone told you they had 2+2 oranges. You would probably interpret that as them having 4 oranges, rather than storing that information as 2+2. You have evaluated their statement. Now suppose you must flag anyone who has more than 3 oranges. If the person said they had 2+2 oranges, you would first determine that the total is 4, then you would determine *if* 4 exceeds the limit. Python evaluates expression in much the same way. So when Python encounters an 'if' block, it trys to evalute the expression after the 'if' keyword down to a boolean value. A statement that evaluates to a boolean is a boolean statement. If the boolean statement following the 'if' keyword evaluates to True, Python proceeds to process the indented block of code after the ':'. Otherwise, it skips to the next non-indented line. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of simple functions built into Python with which you can construct basic boolean statements. For numerical comparisons, you can use '>', '<', '>=', '<=', '==', and '!='. Note that '==' is very different than '=' in Python! One checks whether the left and right are the same, and the other sets the left to the value on the right. '!=' is a programming way of writing 'not equal'. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if Python expects to see a boolean value and sees an integer, it will not throw an error. Any non-zero integer will be interpreted as True, while 0 will be interpreted as False. In fact, any non-empty/zero data will be interpreted as True, while empty/zero data will be interpreted as False. This is not behavior to lean on, however, as this can change the datatype of the output and cause unexpected behavior later on in the program. Let's see a few boolean expression in action."

    "## Boolean Operations\n",

    "Boolean operations are functions that take boolean inputs and produce boolean output. These are foundation to computer science all the way to the hardware level, and they are also very functional in our day-to-day programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main boolean *operators* you will use are 'not', 'and', and 'or'. These functions do pretty much exactly what you'd think. 'not' simply returns the opposite of the input. 'and' returns True if and only if both inputs are True, otherwise, it returns False. 'or' returns True if either of the inputs are True, otherwise it returns False. There are numerous other operators like XOR, NOR, etc., but we'll leave those for you to investigate on your own. Any boolean operator you want can be created as a combination of 'not', 'and', and 'or'. Computer scientists will visualize the operation of a boolean operator via a *truth table*. These simply show the output for all 4 possible input states (all boolean operations except 'not' take 2 boolean inputs so 2x2 is 4 possibilities). Try filling out the truth tables below for 'and' and 'or'.\n",

Even though it makes sense to you that 'for i in 10' means 'for each value between 1 and 10', the computer doesn't see it that way. The range() function takes our integer length and forms the group of numbers from 0 up to (and not including) the number we input. Let's see that to let it sink in."

When the 'while' keyword is reached, the following expression is evaluated. If True, the block is run. Otherwise, it is skipped. If the block is run, when it gets to the end, the program is redirected back to the 'while' keyword, whose expression is evaluated once again. This happens until the expression evaluates to False. \n",
