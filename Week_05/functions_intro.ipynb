    "When you write a function, it is important to test it to ensure the output makes sense for the input. Test your function with known input-output combinations. Even if you don't know what the exact output should be, you can get a sense of whether yours is feasible (e.g. standard deviation should be positive). This testing ensures that if you and others can trust your fuction in the future, even without reviewing every line of the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing becomes more important with increased complexity. You may be able to quickly verify an addition function but a function to extract gravitational wave signals from LIGO data would require much more testing. One thing that increases with complexity is the number of boundary cases. Boundary cases are inputs that are likely to break your function, often because they are outside the inteded scope. Imagine inputting 0 into a division function. If you don't handle that properly, it could cause bugs in downstream programs that rely on your function. Always try to imagine what a user might do which might break your function and handle it properly. This is called *defensive programming* and will make your code much more stable, resilient, and reliable.\n",
