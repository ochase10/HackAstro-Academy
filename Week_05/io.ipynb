    "# Intro to I/O\n",
    "\n",
    "I/O stands for input/output and is extremely important for accomplishing our science goals. This is not the same type of input/output we discussed with functions. Rather, in this case I/O refers to how we retrieve external data and how we write data to external files. This is very common as data is often far too large to hand type into our programs, and we would rather not copy-paste terminal output into permanent storage files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python gives us easy access to files on our computer for reading and writing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing a file is as simple as invoking the built-in open() function. This creates a file input or output stream which we can save to a variable. When we open a file, we must tell Python what we plan to do with it: read or write. If a file is opened in read-mode, you will not be able to write to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "**CAUTION** Opening a file (which already exists) in write-mode will delete the contents of the file, immediately and irrevocably, without warning. Always be careful when opening a file in write-mode. This is why the default behavior of open() is to use read-mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to write a file, we can pass 'w' as the second argument to open() (with or without the keyword mode=). If we want to write to a file which exists *without* deleting it first, we can use the mode 'r+' or 'a' for append-mode. This will allow us to read the file and add to it without wiping it first. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we are done using a file, it is good coding habit to close() is using the .close() method. This ensures that Python disconnects from the file, allowing other processes on your computer to access it without issue. Generally, Python will close files automatically when the session terminates, but it's always good to keep track of what files you have open. There is a simple block syntax built into Python that can handle file cleanup and variable assignment for us using the 'with' keyword, which we'll introduce below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final consideration for file I/O goes back to filesystems and working dirctories. Whenever you launch Python, you do so from some working directory. Referencing files in Python is identical to how you'd reference files in bash given your working directory. Files in the same directory can be accessed simply with their file names. Files outside the working directory require either an absolute or relative path. Keep this in mind if you ever get a FileNotFoundError. Double check that you are pointing to the correct directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all that said, let's open our first file. The Week_05 directory contains a data file named 'wavelength.dat', which we will use for this example."

    "You'll notice we used readline() instead of read() in the above example. Often times, we don't want to read an entire file all at once. We usually want to process each line independently. We can do that with readline(). Each call to readline() returns the file's contents up to the next newline character as a string. It also advances the *pointer* of the file stream to just after the final read character. This means that when we call readline() again, it will read the next line, rather than the first one again. In general, our file pointer only moves forward in the file as we read it. It can be moved back or to specific locations, but this is rarely necessary. When the pointer reaches the end of the file, readline() will return only empty strings for all subsequent calls.\n",
