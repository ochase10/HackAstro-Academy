This week's checkpoint challenge is to write a function that creates a box.
You can implement this in a standalone .py file or within a notebook.

Your function should take an integer and print a box with that side length.

An example call might look like:

makeBox(4) ->

####
#  #
#  #
####


or makeBox(10) -> 

##########
#        #
#        #
#        #
#        #
#        #
#        #
#        #
#        #
##########


For an added challenge, have your function take an optional second argument which indicates what
character to use in building the box.

Ex: makeBox(5, "*") -> 

*****
*   *
*   *
*   *
*****

Make sure your function handles bad input properly!
