Your challenge for this checkpoint is to write a Python program that checks whether the 
user inputs a valid password.

The requirements of the password are it must contain:
 - at least 8 characters
 - at most 4 numbers
 - both upper case and lower case characters
 - EXACTLY 2 special characters

If the password is valid, your program should print "Success!" to the screen.
Otherwise, it should tell the user to try again.

For an added challenge, the retry prompt can tell the user why their password was invalid.

Make sure to test your program! 

Here are some example usages:

> Please enter a valid password: h3*tXm9uf_x

> Success!

>
__________________________________________

> Please enter a valid password:  my_passworD

> That password is invalid! Please try again: thi$is_MyPassw0rd

> Success!
