Exercise 1:

Write a program that takes a sentence as input and counts the occurrences of each word in the sentence. 
Ignore capitalization and punctuation.

Example output:
Input: "The cat sat on the mat. The dog sat on the mat."
Output: {'the': 3, 'cat': 1, 'sat': 2, 'on': 2, 'mat': 2, 'dog': 1}

Exercise 2:

Write a program that categorizes student scores into letter grades. 
Given a dictionary of student names and scores, update it with their letter grade.

Input:
students = {
    "Alice": 85,
    "Bob": 92,
    "Charlie": 76,
    "David": 59
}

Output:

grades = {
    "Alice": "B",
    "Bob": "A",
    "Charlie": "C",
    "David": "F"
}

Exercise 3:

1. Compute the escape velocity for each object:

    v_esc = sqrt(2GM/R)

    Where G is the gravitational constant
    M is the mass of the object
    R is the Radius

2. Compute the average mass, velocity, and radius across all objects.
3. Find the most massive, fastest, and largest object and print out their IDs for each.
