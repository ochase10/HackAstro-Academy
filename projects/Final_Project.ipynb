    "# Fitting Emission Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to working with spectra is being able to measure the line flux of an emission line. This is done by fitting a Gaussian model to the emission line. This process can be a bit more complicated if the lines are blended, meaning that what looks to be one line in the spectra is actually made up of a variety of other emission lines. In the next section we go over how to fit an emission line and slowly increase the complexity of the model and fitting routines."

    "# Using Curve Fit\n",
    "\n",
    "Curve fit is a very powerful tool to fit any model to any kind of data. The power of curve_fit comes from the ability to have a custom model that the user can create. The one condition for this function that the user defines is just that it has to be in the format that curve_fit expects it in. The format for this function is f(x, param1, param2, ...) where x is the first argument in the function and then the rest are the parameters you are trying to fit in any order you like. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of fitting an emission line we will be fitting a Gaussian to this and so our model will have the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$G(x) = Ae^{\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here A represents the amplitude of the Gaussian and controls the height of the Gaussian. $\\mu$ controls where the Gaussian is centered and this should correspond to the wavelength of the emission line. $\\sigma$ controls how wide the emission line is, a larger value of $\\sigma$ means a broader line. x in this example corresponds to your wavelength array. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the units of A, $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are solely determined by the data you provide curve_fit. So if the spectra is in units of Jy then the Amplitude will have units of Jy, if the wavelength inputted is in microns then $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ will be in microns. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function curve_fit takes in some parameters and then you can customize it further with other key-word arguments. The basic input to get curve_fit to start fitting is it needs the model that you are trying to fit in the format specified above, the x and y data, and an intitial guess to start the process to finding the best fit parameters.\n",

    "    x-data\n",
    "    y-data\n",
    "    Initial Guesses\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of curve fit will be two things, the first thing you will get back is the best fit parameter values and the second is a covariance matrix that holds the uncertainties and correlations of each of the parameters. The thing we are really after is the best fit parameters so we will not cover the covariance matrix in too much detail as we will be using more sophisticated ways of getting the error on our parameters in the upcoming notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Outputs:\n",
    "    Best Fit Parameters\n",
    "    Covariance Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "The best fit parameters will be stored in one variable as a list and they will be in the same order as your user-defined model, so to access a certain parameter you will need to use python indexing for that. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us code this model up in Python and use it to fit an emission line."

Here A is the amplitude of the Gaussian, $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian. \n",

If you do this then you get the following:\n",
