In the same folder as this notebook, you should see a file called 'firas_monopole_spec_v1.txt'. This is data from the COBE satellite taken from this paper: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...473..576F/abstract. You are going to fit this data with a blackbody spectrum to determine the temperature of the CMB.\n",
